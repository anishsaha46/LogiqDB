# Simple Database System

This project implements a basic database system with features such as:

* **Table Creation:** Create tables with specified columns and data types.
* **Data Insertion:** Insert rows of data into tables.
* **Data Retrieval:** Select and display data from tables.
* **Data Deletion:** Delete rows from tables based on conditions.
* **Left Join:** Perform left join operations between two tables.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Compile the code:**
   - Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like g++) installed.
   - Compile the code using a command like:
     ```bash
     g++ -o database_system main.o Table.o QueryProcessor.o FileManager.o
     ```

2. **Run the program:**
   - Execute the compiled program:
     ```bash
     ./database_system
     ```

**Usage:**

*   The program currently supports the following basic SQL-like queries:
    *   `INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ...)`
    *   `SELECT`
    *   `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition`
    *   `JOIN table1 ON table2` (currently supports basic inner joins)
    *   `LEFT JOIN table1 ON table2`

*   The program uses plain text files to store table data.

**Limitations:**

*   Limited query support (no complex joins, aggregations, etc.).
*   Basic error handling.
*   No data type enforcement.
*   No indexing for improved performance.

**Future Enhancements:**

*   Implement more advanced query features (e.g., WHERE clause with more operators, GROUP BY, ORDER BY).
*   Add support for data types (e.g., integers, floats, dates).
*   Implement indexing for faster data retrieval.
*   Improve error handling and data validation.
*   Consider using a database library (like SQLite) for more robust functionality.

**Note:**

This is a basic implementation for educational purposes. For production-level database systems, consider using established database solutions.
